## Introduction
This code represents a simple implementation of a library management system using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and SQLite for the database management. The application consists of two main components:

Main Application: This component provides a user-friendly interface to view, search, and sort books. Users can add new books, view details of selected books, and see the overall status of their library (total books, read books, unread books).

Add Book Window: This component allows users to add new books to the library. Users can enter details such as the book's title, author, year of publication, and ISBN.

## Installation
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Tkinter and SQLite3 do not need to be listed since they are included with Python.

### Running the Application
```python
python main.py
```

## Library Used
